## Demo

[Focus fixer](https://nateking.ca/remote/keyboard-focus.html) - the keyboard-focus.html file uses jQuery to dynamically manipulate the structure of elements to generate links. It is paired with CSS that will show a different focus state based on whether the interaction is keyboard vs click.
